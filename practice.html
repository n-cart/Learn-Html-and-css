        <p class="more-readable">You are probably wondering,<br><q class="standout">Why did Nick make a whole new html file?</q></br>This is to practice some more of the .css formating I learned.</p>
        <p>Below is an exerpt from <q>The Office</q> written in blockquote</p>
        <blockquote><p>What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.</p></blockquote>
